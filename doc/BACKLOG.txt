The following are items that would be good features to include in the future:

1. Restricted access to DUMC members only - all Duke affiliated workers are currently allowed
2. Status page that allows users to see the status of all their teammates
3. Smartphone applications to replace the SMS messaging system for on-call verification
4. GPS tracking option to allow hospital staff to view physical distance away from hospital
5. CSV uploads to parse employee information
