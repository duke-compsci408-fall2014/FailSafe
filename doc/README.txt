PURPOSE

Dealing with a heart attack is a time-critical operation. No more than ninety minutes should pass between the
time an incident is reported and the time that the catheter operation is completed. 
The current alert system used by Duke Hospital is unreliable. 
Contact information and shift substitutions are recorded by pen and paper 
and are subject to being lost or becoming out of date. 
The pagers that the doctors use are similarly antiquated;
several minutes can pass between the time an operator sends a page and a doctor receives it. 
Sometimes, pages are missed entirely, and one or more members of the six-person team can miss the operation entirely.
This is unacceptable. 
Our application seeks to both centralize critical contact and scheduling information for the ICU 
and reduce the time taken to notify oncall medical teams of an emergency. 
This should allow emergency operations to start sooner and thus increase the probability of a patient’s survival.
